# IoT 2021 - Project

## Python Virtual Environment

We will use a Python Virtual Environment for not messing up with the entire OS files. 

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

Use the virtual environment

```shell
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Tip: For leaving the virtual environment type 

```shell
deactivate
```

## The Objectives
